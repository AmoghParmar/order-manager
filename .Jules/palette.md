## 2026-07-22 - Missing ARIA Labels on Ionic Modals
**Learning:** Found a widespread pattern across many modal components where `<ion-button>` elements containing only an `<ion-icon>` lacked `aria-label` attributes. This is a common accessibility trap in Ionic/Vue applications because visually the icon conveys the meaning (e.g. `closeOutline` for dismissing a modal, `trashOutline` for delete), but screen readers announce nothing useful for the button without the label.
**Action:** Always add `:aria-label="translate('[Action]')"` (e.g. 'Close', 'Delete', 'Options') to `<ion-button>` elements that rely solely on an `<ion-icon>` for their visual representation to ensure proper accessibility for screen reader users.

## 2024-07-23 - Add ARIA Labels to Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like `<ion-button>` and `<ion-fab-button>`) frequently miss `aria-label`s in this app, making them inaccessible to screen reader users because the purpose of the action is visually communicated only by an icon.
**Action:** When finding an icon-only button without visible text, always check for an `aria-label` (using the `translate()` function when possible for internationalization) to improve accessibility. Look specifically at `ion-fab-button`s, as they often just contain an icon.

## 2024-07-25 - Missing ARIA Labels on Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Found a widespread accessibility pattern in the application where icon-only `<ion-button>` elements containing `<ion-icon>` frequently lack `aria-label`s. This makes them inaccessible to screen readers, as the icon alone provides no semantic meaning.
**Action:** When working on UI components, actively scan for and add `:aria-label="translate('Action Name')"` to all icon-only buttons to ensure they remain accessible.
## 2025-07-25 - Icon-only buttons accessibility pattern
**Learning:** Many icon-only buttons (`<ion-button>` with an inner `<ion-icon>`) across the application are missing both `aria-label`s for screen readers and `slot="icon-only"` on the inner icon for proper Ionic alignment.
**Action:** When creating or reviewing UI components, especially modals and lists, explicitly verify that all buttons containing only icons have a localized `aria-label` (using `translate()`) and that the `<ion-icon>` has `slot="icon-only"`.
## 2024-07-28 - Internationalization of ARIA labels
**Learning:** Found several icon-only buttons with hardcoded English strings for accessibility (e.g. `aria-label="Close"`). This degrades the experience for screen reader users relying on localized interfaces.
**Action:** Always wrap standard aria-label attributes with the application's `translate()` function (e.g. `:aria-label="translate('Close')"`) to ensure icon-only buttons remain accessible across all supported languages.

## 2024-05-18 - Missing ARIA labels and Icon slots on Ionic Close Buttons
**Learning:** Ionic `<ion-button>` elements containing only an `<ion-icon>` need `slot="icon-only"` on the icon element for proper UI spacing/layout, and they absolutely require an `aria-label` (or `:aria-label="translate('Key')"`) for screen readers, which was missing in several modal close buttons across the app.
**Action:** When adding or auditing icon-only buttons (especially modal close buttons), ensure both `:aria-label="translate('...')"` is present on the button and `slot="icon-only"` is added to the `<ion-icon>` to guarantee both visual correctness and accessibility.
## 2024-07-30 - Missing ARIA labels on Ionic Fab Buttons
**Learning:** Ionic `<ion-fab-button>` elements are often missed during accessibility audits for missing ARIA labels because they function as primary action buttons and are visually distinct, but they remain completely inaccessible to screen readers without them.
**Action:** Always verify that `<ion-fab-button>` elements that only contain an `<ion-icon>` include an explicit `aria-label` attribute.
## 2024-08-04 - Missing ARIA Labels on ion-fab-button
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of icon-only `<ion-fab-button>` components without an `aria-label` attribute. While these buttons function as visually distinct primary action buttons, they require an explicit `aria-label` for screen reader accessibility since the inner `<ion-icon>` does not convey meaning to assistive technologies.
**Action:** When creating or auditing `<ion-fab-button>` elements that only contain icons, always ensure the `aria-label` attribute is set using the `translate()` function (e.g., `:aria-label="translate('Save')"`) to guarantee accessibility and localization.
## 2024-05-24 - External Link Indicators
**Learning:** Adding an `openOutline` icon to buttons with `target="_blank"` improves predictability by visually warning users that the action will open in a new tab.
**Action:** Always append `<ion-icon slot="end" :icon="openOutline" />` to elements that open external resources in a new tab.
## 2026-08-08 - Adding loading states to destructive actions\n**Learning:** Destructive actions, such as deleting a customer profile, often use an icon-only button (e.g., trash icon) without visual feedback during asynchronous processing. In Vue and Ionic applications, these async processes typically have a reactive state flag (e.g., `deleting`).\n**Action:** When inspecting destructive or asynchronous actions in icon-only buttons, replace the default icon with an `<ion-spinner>` when the async state is true. Ensure the `<ion-spinner>` has the `slot="icon-only"` attribute to maintain proper alignment during loading.
## 2024-08-30 - Localizing UI Text
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of hardcoded UI strings (e.g., 'View history', 'Merged Contacts', 'Merge') in template files that missed the localization pass. This leads to inconsistent user experience for international users who expect all interface elements to be translated.
**Action:** Always wrap plain text strings in Vue templates with the application's `translate()` function (e.g., `{{ translate('Text') }}`) to ensure full localization coverage.
## 2024-05-14 - FAB Button Loading States
**Learning:** In Ionic applications, `<ion-fab-button>` elements behave differently than standard `<ion-button>` elements when adding loading states. While a standard icon-only `<ion-button>` requires `slot="icon-only"` on its inner `<ion-spinner>` to maintain layout, an `<ion-fab-button>` centers its content by default, and its inner elements do not need the `slot="icon-only"` attribute.
**Action:** When adding async loading feedback to primary action `<ion-fab-button>` elements, use standard `v-if/v-else` conditional rendering to swap the `<ion-icon>` with an `<ion-spinner>` without worrying about slot overrides, while remembering to bind `:disabled="isSubmitting"` to prevent double submissions.
## 2026-09-19 - Add aria-labels to icon-only ion-segment-button\n**Learning:** In Ionic Vue, icon-only `<ion-segment-button>` components require an explicit `:aria-label` (using the `translate()` function) to ensure proper screen reader accessibility, as they lack visible text.\n**Action:** Always verify that icon-only buttons (including segment buttons, fab buttons) have appropriate ARIA attributes.
## 2026-09-23 - Ionic ion-button vs raw a tags
**Learning:** The application uses raw a tags in some places with openOutline icons. This breaks visual consistency and can cause focus state and accessibility issues. Ionic's ion-button natively supports href, target, and rel attributes and renders a compliant anchor tag internally.
**Action:** When adding external links or reviewing them, upgrade a tags to ion-button fill='clear' to maintain keyboard accessibility, correct focus styling, and general UI cohesion within the app.
## 2024-05-18 - Visual Loading Feedback for ion-fab-button
**Learning:** `ion-fab-button` elements performing asynchronous actions often lack a visual loading indicator (e.g. `ion-spinner`), only relying on a `disabled` state which can feel unresponsive. Unlike `ion-button`, `ion-fab-button` uses the Shadow DOM and only has a default slot. Therefore, inner elements like `ion-spinner` should NOT use `slot="icon-only"`, as this will hide them.
**Action:** When auditing `ion-fab-button` components, check if their action is asynchronous (e.g. form submission or API save). If so, introduce an `isSubmitting` / `isSaving` ref, disable the button when true, and conditionally render an `ion-spinner` (without `slot="icon-only"`) in place of the default `ion-icon`.

## 2024-09-28 - Missing empty states for data lists
**Learning:** When displaying dynamic data lists (e.g. `<ion-list>` rendered conditionally via `v-for`), if the dataset is empty, the UI can feel broken or collapsed. Adding a fallback empty state using an `<ion-item v-else lines="none">` with a `translate()` wrapped `ion-label` makes the UI much more communicative and polished.
**Action:** Before rendering lists, always verify if there is a possibility that the underlying data might be empty. If so, apply an empty state layout, such as a fallback item explaining "No items found".
## 2025-10-08 - Added IonSpinner to async <ion-fab-button>
**Learning:** Found that <ion-fab-button> instances used for saving forms within modals were relying solely on the `:disabled="saving"` attribute. While they were not double-submitting, they lacked explicit visual loading feedback (like an <ion-spinner>) which is a better UX pattern for async actions. Additionally, verified that we shouldn't use `slot="icon-only"` inside `<ion-fab-button>` because it uses the Shadow DOM and only has a default unnamed slot, otherwise the element is hidden.
**Action:** Replaced static save icons with conditional `<ion-spinner>` indicators within the `<ion-fab-button>` for modal submit actions, and ensured `IonSpinner` was imported in the script setup.

## 2026-09-27 - Async Feedback on Icon-only Action Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only action buttons (like `<ion-fab-button>`) that execute asynchronous actions (like saving or submitting forms) often rely solely on the `disabled` state for feedback. This lack of visual change during the action degrades UX and accessibility, especially when the async action takes longer to resolve.
**Action:** When working with async action buttons, specifically `<ion-fab-button>` in Ionic, always incorporate an inline loading spinner (e.g. `<ion-spinner v-if="submitting" name="crescent" />`) conditionally replacing the default icon to provide immediate, clear system status feedback.

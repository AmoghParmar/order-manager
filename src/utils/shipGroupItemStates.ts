 * `get#OrderFulfillmentTimeline` records how far a *moving* group has travelled, but says
 * nothing about one that has stopped — and on some instances it records almost nothing at all.
 * Deriving the card purely from those dates left a finished group reading "25% Complete" with
 * Pick/Pack/Ship still "Pending", because a physical facility scores 25% for being brokered and
 * no later date ever arrives.
 *
 * Only three numbers are needed. "All fulfilled", "all cancelled" and "partially fulfilled" are
 * each one comparison away from them, and naming them here bought nothing: `fulfilled / total`
 * already answers all three for progress, and the label derives the two it distinguishes.
 *
 * Items without a `statusId` are skipped rather than counted as unfinished: a group whose
 * statuses have not loaded yet should read as in-progress, not as freshly cancelled.

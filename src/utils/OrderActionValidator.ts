/**
 * OrderActionValidator (SALES order variant) — DRAFT v2
 * =================================================================
 * Adapted from the transfers app's `src/utils/OrderActionValidator.ts`, but
 * re-modeled for the SALES order reality of order-manager.
 *
 * ── How a SALES order's lifecycle is modeled here ───────────────────────────
 * Unlike the transfers app, a sales order has NO `statusFlowId` on its payload
 * (statusFlowId exists only on seed `StatusFlowTransition` rows, never on the
 * order). So decisions here key on TWO layers:
 *
 *   1. STATUS LAYER (transition-table driven). Header status
 *      (ORDER_CREATED/APPROVED/HOLD/COMPLETED/CANCELLED) and item status
 *      (ITEM_CREATED/APPROVED/COMPLETED/CANCELLED/REJECTED/HOLD). The
 *      "what status can legally follow this status" question is OWNED BY THE
 *      SEED TRANSITION TABLE, not by this file. We accept an injected
 *      set per status level (from `seed.allowedTransitions(statusId)`) and
 *      INTERSECT it with lifecycle gating rather than hardcoding the graph.
 *      See `canTransitionTo()` and ctx.orderAllowedToStatusIds /
 *      ctx.itemAllowedToStatusIds.
 *
 *   2. SIDE-CONDITION LAYER. Hold tasks are INFORMATIONAL ONLY — product
 *      decision 2026-06-11: an open hold NEVER prevents a ship group from
 *      being brokered or items from being released. No action in this engine
 *      gates on holds.
 *
 * Fulfillment phase (brokered / picked / packed / shipped) is NOT a gate here.
 * Cancel and pull-back are gated by terminal status and the transition table
 * only. A per-store phase cut-off was drafted against company-app config
 * (hotwax/company#158) that no caller ever supplied, so every phase check was
 * unreachable; it was removed rather than left in place looking live. If that
 * config lands, reintroduce it together with the caller that populates it.
 *
 * ── Footer scope ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The footer offers the seed table's status transitions plus the bulk
 * "Cancel items" (hidden while cancels do not reach Shopify). Return,
 * Appeasement, Reship and Clone were modelled here without a reachable
 * handler and were removed: returns are hotwax/order-manager#6, the rest
 * #554 (Appeasement), #555 (Reship) and #556 (Clone).
 *
 * `any` for payloads matches house style.
 *

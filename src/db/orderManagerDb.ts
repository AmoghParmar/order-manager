/**
 * Order Manager Dexie Database Instance & Stored Entities.
 *
 * The database is scoped per OMS instance, so switching instances lands on a different
 * IndexedDB database instead of reading the previous tenant's rows.
 *
 * This module must never statically import `commonUtil` or the `@common` barrel. The sync
 * worker imports it for `getOrderManagerDb`, and an ES import is unconditional — the barrel
 * would be bundled into the worker chunk (dragging in @ionic/vue, luxon, papaparse and a
 * Pinia store) even though the worker never touches it, and Vite must emit that chunk as a
 * single iife. Hence the two entry points below:
 *
 *   getOrderManagerDb(omsInstance)  the instance is a parameter — for the worker entry only,
 *                                   which hands it to the sync harness
 *   orderManagerDb.entity(table)    every read and write: resolves the instance via a resolver
 *                                   the app registers at boot (useLiveEntity for live reads)
 *
 * Deep imports, not the `@common/db` barrel, for the same reason.
